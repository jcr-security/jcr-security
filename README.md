### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ“« **Looking for someone to audit your Smart Contract**? ðŸ“«
* Drop a line to **@jcr_auditor** in Telegram or email me at **audits@jcrsecurity.io**  

Breaking things professionally since early 2016. Most of my career has been focused on offensive security and pentesting of "traditional" stuff like web, mobile or cloud but since 2021 I have been working full time as Smart Contract auditor.

Recently started **teaching** a couple of **Solidity/EVM** security courses to ðŸŒ±blockchain mewcommersðŸŒ±

Current expertise:
- CosmWasm (Rust) âš¡âš¡âš¡âš¡âš¡
- Solidity/EVM    âš¡âš¡âš¡
- NEAR (RUST)     âš¡

:mag::unlock: Currently auditing for [Oak Security](https://www.oaksecurity.io/) but also avilable for "solo audits" as a contractor.

:eyeglasses::books: Teaching Smart Contract security at [University of Malaga](https://www.nics.uma.es/Blockchain/) and [IEBS bussiness school](https://www.iebschool.com/programas/master-en-blockchain-y-criptoactivos/)
